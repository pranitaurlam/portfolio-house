# 🌷 Hi, I’m Pranita

A quiet learner with a strong curiosity for technology. I enjoy building simple, interactive things on the web and growing step by step.

## ✨ About Me

I’m a first-year tech student exploring the world of software development through hands-on projects. I believe in learning slowly, deeply, and consistently rather than rushing for quick results.

Right now, I’m focusing on strengthening my fundamentals while building clean and interactive frontend experiences.
